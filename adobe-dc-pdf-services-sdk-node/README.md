>Dependencies:
1. @adobe/pdfservices-node-sdk: This is the Adobe PDF Services Node.js SDK that provides the necessary APIs for working with Adobe PDF Services.
2. fs: The built-in Node.js module for file system operations.
3. unzipper: A library for extracting files from a ZIP archive.
4. csv-writer: A library for writing data to CSV files.


>Libraries and Functions:
1. PDFServicesSdk: The main library for working with Adobe PDF Services. It provides classes and methods for authentication, execution context, extract PDF operation, options, and file references.
2. Credentials: A class from the PDFServicesSdk library used to create an instance of the PDF Services SDK credentials. In this code, it is used to create service principal credentials using the provided client ID and client secret.
3. ExecutionContext: A class from the PDFServicesSdk library used to create an execution context using the credentials.
4. ExtractPdfOptions: A class from the PDFServicesSdk library used to define options for the extract PDF operation. In this code, it is configured to extract both text and tables and generate the table structure in JSON format.
5. ExtractPDF.Operation: A class from the PDFServicesSdk library used to create a new extract PDF operation.
6. FileRef: A class from the PDFServicesSdk library used to create a file reference from the input PDF file path.
7. saveAsFile(): A method provided by the result of the extract PDF operation to save the extracted data as a ZIP file.
8. unzipper.Open.file(): A function from the unzipper library used to open the generated ZIP file and extract the JSON file from it.
9. JSON.parse(): A built-in JavaScript function used to parse the JSON data from the extracted buffer.
10. createCsvWriter(): A function from the csv-writer library used to create a CSV writer object.
11. writeRecords(): A method provided by the CSV writer object to write records (data) to the CSV file.
12. getValueFromJsonPath(): A helper function defined in the code to retrieve a value from a JSON object based on the given JSON path. It splits the path into     keys and iterates over them to navigate the JSON structure and retrieve the value.

The code is responsible for authenticating with Adobe PDF Services using the provided client ID and client secret. It then configures the extract PDF operation with the desired options (text and table extraction) and executes the operation on the input PDF file. The resulting extracted data is saved as a ZIP file. The code then extracts the JSON file from the ZIP archive, parses it, and retrieves the required data using the defined column names and JSON paths. Finally, it writes the extracted data to a CSV file using the csv-writer library.
